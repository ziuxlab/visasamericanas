                    Strategically located on the northern coast of the South American continent, Colombia is the perfect
                    quick getaway from the US (3.5 hours from Ft Lauderdale) - a paradise of perfectly consistent
                    year-round semi-tropical climate; virtually no seasons but with plenty of biodiversity and
                    geographic contrasts nearly impossible to find elsewhere.<br><br>The benevolence of the Colombian
                    people
                    and their joy and passion for life are qualities inherent to them - creative, positive, cheerful and
                    immensely proud of their country and its rich history and culture, delicious food (the native trout
                    is to die for), and scenic beauty. Colombians will captivate your heart by showing you what a friend
                    looks like for perhaps the first time.
                    <br><br>According to the World Tourism Organization, international tourism in Colombia increased 7%
                    in
                    2012, 4% in 2013, 13% in 2014 and, 16% in 2015 all year over year. The colombian President Juan
                    Manuel Santos announced the past March that the tourism in Colombia rose 12,6% in 2016…a clear
                    indication that the world is awakening to this rapidly modernizing, exotic destination. In 2015, 61%
                    of international tourists to Colombia flew in from North/Central/South America, 13% from Europe and
                    26% from the rest of the world. <br><br>
                    Lastly, for those travelers with lingering safety concerns, the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to the
                    current Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos in 2016, in recognition of the enormously successful
                    efforts by Colombia to secure peace and disarm the few remaining Las FARC jungle rebels in the
                    north, and at the same time to disinhibit even more world travelers to the country so they can enjoy
                    and learn from this rich culture. Las FARC has not been active anywhere in Quindío in a decade.

                        Lying in the “Cordillera Central”, the central highlands of Colombia, is the Quindío department,
                        one
                        of the smallest “departments” (known as counties in the US) in Colombia, which in contrast to
                        its
                        small size has a nearly endless number of natural resources and attractions that motivate the
                        thousands of Colombians and world travelers to visit each year. The region has a host of
                        features
                        that promise to make your vacation unforgettable, such as short distances on good roads between
                        major points of interest, convenient travel alternatives to reach these destinations and
                        uniqueness
                        of each place despite their relative proximity. <br><br>
                        High mountains, mammoth coffee farms, the finest coffee tasting in the world,
                        banana/plátano/papaya
                        plantations, theme parks, adventure sports, ubiquitous natural springs/rivers/streams, camping,
                        hiking to snow covered volcanoes and lush valleys of infinite greenery are just some of the
                        attractions that Quindío has to offer for residents and travelers alike. With such natural and
                        cultural resources and a consolidated tourism infrastructure it is no miracle that Quindío
                        Colombia
                        is a totally gratifying experience, one that your heart will want to repeat over and over again.
